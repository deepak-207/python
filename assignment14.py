#SOLUTION: 
f=open("assignment14.txt",encoding="utf8")
content=f.readlines()
print(content)
f.close()a
n=int(input("enter the last line number from where u want to read: "))
while n>0:
 print(content[-n])
 n=n-1
 

#QUESTION:2 Write a Python program to count the frequency of words in a file. 
#SOLUTION:
words=open("assignment14.txt","r",encoding="utf8").read().split()
print(words)
print(type(words))
uniqWords=sorted(set(words))
print(type(uniqWords))
for word in uniqWords:
 print(words.count(word),word)


#QUESTION:3 Write a Python program to copy the contents of a file to another file
#SOLUTION:
with open("deep.txt","r",encoding="utf8") as f1:
 with open("assignment14.txt","w") as f2:
  for line in f1:
   f2.write(line)
   

#QUESTION:4 Write a Python program to combine each line from first file with the corresponding line in second file.
#SOLUTION:
with open("deep.txt","r",encoding="utf8") as f1:
   with open("assignment14.txt","r") as f2:
     for line1,line2 in zip(f1,f2):
       print(line1+line2)


#QUESTION:5 Write a Python program to write 10 random numbers into a file. 
#           Read the file and then sort the numbers and then store it to another file.
#SOLUTION:
import random

with open("assignment14.txt", "w") as f:
    for i in range(10):
        numbers = str(random.randint(1, 100))
        f.writelines(numbers + '\n')
        print(numbers)

with open("assignment14.txt") as f1, open("deep.txt", "w") as f2:
    numbers = f1.read().split()
    numbers.sort()
    print(numbers)
    for n in numbers:
        f2.write(n)
        f2.write("\n")
